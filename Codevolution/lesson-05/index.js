// Lesson 05

// Next.js has a file system based routing mechanism

// URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.
// There some rules that needs to be followed in order to get file-based routing -

// 1. All routes must be placed inside the app folder
// 2. Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx.
// 3. Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.

// If you try to access a route that don't exist, Next.js automatically puts a 404 error page.
